### Why it's so hard to find a good static generator able to deal with multi language content?

It seems that there is an huge number of [static generators](https://www.staticgen.com/about) out there, yet they seems to fit inside very constrained categories, when seeing from a polyglot perspective:

- coded by geniuses, for geniuses
- coded by one-language-speakers
- too much opinionated in regard content layout

So, I decided to use this year to try out as much generators as possible, trying to produce easily maintainable website scaffold with multi language content. This blog is produced with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which to me fits in the third category.

I'll experiment with the most used one - [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - and more modern ones, like [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io/).

I'll post here my finds and considerations. Stay tuned!
