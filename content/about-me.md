# So, here we are: who am I?

I'm an italian born guy, currently living in Brazil. I studied to became am artisan, mainly
 a designer and sculptor however, being caught by the love for music during my teen ages I 
turned myself in a musician and, later, in a luthier.

Some constant in my life is my nerdish lifestyle: I always wished to go deeper and deeper in
 my understanding of life and nature, and those are very nerdish qualities IMHO.
That's mean that I have very broad interests, going from natural sciences - physics, cosmology, 
mathematic, geometry... - to human sciences - history, anthropology, phylosophy, religions...

I'm currently able to code in C# (fairly well), Python and JavaScript (both at an intermediate level) and learning my way in F#. Quite reasonably, my favourites computer tools are bash, git, powershell and vim...
I do not dislike vscode at all, been one of the editor I'm using most, but I can't stop using vim for everything!

Currently, I contribute to many open source projects but, as I'm an avid Elite: Dangerous player, the one I contribute most is [EDDiscovery](github.com/eddiscovery).
