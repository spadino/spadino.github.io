# So, here we are: who am I?

I'm an italian born guy, currently living in Brazil. I studied to became am artisan, mainly
 a designer and sculptor however, being caught by the love for music during my teen ages I 
turned myself in a musician and, later, in a luthier.

Some constant in my life is my nerdish lifestyle: I always wished to go deeper and deeper in
 my understanding of life and nature, and those are very nerdish qualities IMHO.
That's mean that I have very broad interests, going from natural sciences - physics, cosmology, 
mathematic, geometry... - to human sciences - history, anthropology, phylosophy, religions...
